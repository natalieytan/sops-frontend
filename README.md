# Project Summary
Our client's Product Planning & Design Division incorporates several planning, design, development and testing departments all working towards building a better product for their Australian customers.

PPD division's OH&S department have a Safe Operating Procedure (SOP) system in place as part of the company's commitment to providing a safe workplace environment. The Safe Operating Procedures are generally a one to two page document provided to outline the safe procedure for a particular work process. Most employees are required to read and acknowledge that they have read any SOP's for tasks that relate to their job role. This is then recorded by the division OH&S department. 

The challenge is that in the current SOP tracking system is kept using excel spreadsheets and physical paper storage which both managers and employees find to be an inefficient and cumbersome. 

Our solution to this issue is to transfer the current inefficient system to a more automated and streamlined process through on online application. The application will allow employees to log in and view all Safe Operating Procedures they are required to read as well as providing access to all SOP's. Any SOP's read by an employee can be marked and recorded as being read. If a new version of an SOP is uploaded the latest version will be flagged in the employees My SOP page and be made available to read. 

The app will also have an adminstration login which will allow management and the OH&S committee to manage, create and update both users and SOP's.

Using our SOP management application administrators logged in will have access to:

- add, edit and delete users and SOP's
- allocate SOP's to users
- view all SOP's and statistics on viewings
- view individual employee profiles and their viewed SOP's

Staff will be able to login and track

- Which SOP's they are required to read
- Any new versions available of SOP's they have already read
- Which SOP's they have already read
- Employees will have access to all SOP's, including ones they are not required to read, but can do so if they choose to
- Our project will replace the current SOP manual tracking system which will greatly improve efficiency and remove the likelihood of user error.

## User Workflow
Our application is unique in the fact that employees (non-admin users) have much less functionality available to them than admins (managers). A regular user just needs the application to read the SOPs allocated to them by their manager, and agree to having read them.

The admins on the other hand, have the power to create new users, edit current users, create and edit new SOPs and SOP versions, add users to SOPs, manage user's forgotten passwords, manage user's employment status within the company and more.

This discrepancy of usability can be seen most clearly from the below user workflow diagrams;

## Wireframes
We built a significant amount of wireframes on Figma prior to commencing any code. We found this was a very good way of knowing what we were building along the way, both for the front-end and back-end. 

Although there were too many wireframes built to show them all in detail, some examples can be seen below:

Mobile - User (MySOP Page)\

## Challenges
During the production period of our application, we inevitably faced several challenges that put a halt to plans.

The first and perhaps most serious challenge for us, was that due to Toyota Australia’s current IT situation, our app had to be fully compatible with Internet Explorer 11.  

This was a difficult ordeal since IE 11 is incompatible with so many standard and expected browser functions. Every new feature we wanted to implement was first cross checked via a browser compatibility app (below).

Browser compatibility chart.\
![IE Compatibility Image](readme_assets/ie-compat.png "IE Compatibility Image")

So many times we were let down by IE and had to seek alternative paths, whilst still ensuring our app was compatible with modern mobile and tablet devices.

Another notable challenge was security.

Initially we opted to use JSON Web Tokens for a system authentication method. We then decided to store the token in local storage. This seemed to work fine until we kept reading articles doubting the safety of using local storage to store such sensitive information.
We ascertained that the issue really boiled down to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Basically, If an attacker can run Javascript scripts on an app or website, they can retrieve all the data stored in local storage and send it off to their own domain. This means anything sensitive stored in local storage.

The better option which we finally elected was to store the JWT in a secure cookie. This way Javascript could not be implemented against our JWT from the client-side.

Finally, the most significant challenge was the time frame we had. As the project allowed us just 3 weeks to complete our application from design to production, we needed to come up with an excellent time-management plan.

Our attempts of allocating workloads amongst group members were a great way to start. However, many tasks seemed to stretch well over their intended completion times, and inescapably, we put in some long nights to get the work done.

## Improvements
As far as future improvements are concerned, we'd like to implement the following;

- Email notifications. 
  - Each time a new SOP is allocated to an employee's reading list or a new version of a required SOP is uploaded a notification will be received via email.
  - If a user has SOP's in their required to read list for a certain period of time that have been unread a reminder email notification will be sent.

- Full implementation with IE11. Currently our app works on both the Chrome and Safari browsers but has some issues working on IE11.
